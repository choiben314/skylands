IMPORTANTISH
-> When you are making a new class 
and you're expecting to save an object of 
that class in a file, make sure to GENERATE, 
not make the default serial ID. This makes sure 
that when you load the object from the save file there 
is no conflicts (supposedly). Also, make sure 
to mark classes as serializable if they are going to be saved.

Hola.

Pull this repository directly to the src file of an Eclipse project. 
Or you can just pull it to a random folder and edit the files using a 
nice text editor... :/
